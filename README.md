## Claude Code Installation

```bash
/plugin marketplace add OfficialBoomi/boomi-companion
/plugin install bc-integration@boomi-companion
```

Or browse and install via `/plugin` interactively.

## Portable Skills

The integration repo also exposes host-neutral skills for agents that can load
skill folders directly:

- `boomi-integration`: build, sync, deploy, and test Boomi components.
- `boomi-env-setup`: guide `.env` setup and connection testing.
- `boomi-template-workspace`: create or refresh reusable workspace templates.
- `boomi-tidy-up`: clean generated development artifacts.
- `boomi-canvas-arranger`: review step-path integrity and canvas layout.

## Claude Code Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/bc-integration:env-setup-guide` | Interactive Boomi credentials setup |
| `/bc-integration:configure-template-workspace` | Create a reusable project template |
| `/bc-integration:tidy-up` | Clean development artifacts |

After running `configure-template-workspace` in Claude Code, use `/freshies` from any empty directory to scaffold a new project.

## Credential Handling

**Platform configuration credentials** (`.env` file): Your `.env` stores the Boomi API token, account ID, environment IDs, and other platform config needed by the CLI tools. These are necessary for the agent to push, pull, deploy, and test on your behalf.

**How the agent interacts with `.env`**: The project settings and agent instructions steer the agent away from directly reading your `.env` file. The CLI tools load credentials internally — the agent invokes the tools without seeing the credential values. This is a default convenience buffer, not a hard security boundary. Be aware that:

- The `.env` file is a plaintext file on your machine
- The default deny rules in the template workspace `.claude/settings.json` guide the agent away from common file-reading paths, but a sufficiently motivated or creatively prompted agent could find indirect ways to access file contents

If you need stricter isolation, consider Claude Code's [sandboxing options](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/security) or OS-level file permissions.
